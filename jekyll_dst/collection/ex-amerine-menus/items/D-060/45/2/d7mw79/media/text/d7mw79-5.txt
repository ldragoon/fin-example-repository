The sturdy Hermitage wines are grown under the hot sun along the
steep slopes overlooking the Rhone river. Pope Clement V transferred
the seat of the Papacy from Rome to Avignon in the XIV Century, hence
the name “new castle of the Pope”, or “Chateauneuf du Pape” now
given to the vineyards that grow under the shadow of the ruins of the
castle a few miles from Avignon.

ALSATIAN WINES

Although most vineyards and towns of Alsace were battlegrounds
during the last war and destruction was enormous, the sturdy citizens of
this picturesque province have given their villages back their charm and
the damages have almost disappeared. Unlike the other wines of France
the light, dry and fruity Alsatian wines are labeled with the name of the
grape. Their freshness being one of their main attractions they are often
compared to the great German wines of the Rheingau and the Moselle.

Alsatian wines are in a class of their own, lending what they are to the

world of pleasant wines.
