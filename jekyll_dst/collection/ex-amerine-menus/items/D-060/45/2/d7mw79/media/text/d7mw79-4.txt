The business of wine making began in Burgundy 2500 years ago
and by the time of the Roman Conquest it had been so spurred on that
vines were being planted everywhere. Burgundians were so deft at their
art that the last of the Caesars, Domitian, in a.d. 89, furious at their
supremacy in a delicate art, ordered all the vines ripped out. Though
the edict was never fully enforced it took hundreds of years before the
vineyards were producing full capacity again. The greatest vineyards of
Burgundy lay strung along the slope of a hillside some 36 miles long.
These vineyards, through the centuries have been cut up and divided
into small parcels, each with its distinctive wine, but all of them exhibit-
ing the qualities of Burgundy at its very best. This rich hillside, known
as the Cote d’Or is divided into two sections. The one to the north produces
most of the great red wine and is known as the Cote de Nuits. The one
to the south produces many of the better known red wines and most of
the glorious white wines.

Erasmus said that the only good reason we could think of for going
to France was to drink Burgundy on the home grounds.

The Burgundies listed here were selected from leading vineyards

and are all carefully estate-bottled.
