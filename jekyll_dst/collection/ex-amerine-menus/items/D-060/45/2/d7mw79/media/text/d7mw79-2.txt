 

CHAMPAGNE

The most famous wine of all is that aristocrat, Champagne. Ever
since the monk Dom Perignon found the proper stopper in the form of a
cork, to condense second fermentation in the bottle which, gave this
wine its sparkle, Champagne, has been the “life of the party.” Some feel
that Champagne should be reserved for launching a ship, others for
reunions or weddings. They make it the wine for great occasions. However,
you do not need the great occasion to drink champagne, for drinking this
wine makes the occasion. True Champagne is not just any sparkling wine,
but wine usually made from a blend of white and red grapes grown
on chalky hillsides of the Champagne province some 100 miles north-east
of Paris.

At the present time lying in the shadows of Rheims cathedral some
100,000,000 bottles are maturing in long catacombed cellars sometimes
10 miles in length. Yet this supply is insufficient to satisfy increased
world demand, for the deficiency of two recent vintages forced most
Champagne houses to ration their sales, but timely contracting affords
us an opportunity to offer with pride exclusive vintage wine from the
most outstanding houses at prices well below today’s market.
