 Georges Duboeuf is th e acknowledged Dean of wine-maker s and wine merchants in the Beaujolais-Macon area.
 Our colleagues, Sam and Michael Aaron , visited M. Duboeuf at his impressive cellars at Villefranche last April. They enjoyed a long day of
 tasting, during which over 70 barrels were tried - the very best of Beaujolais ahd the Maconnais.
 We selected those cuveesthat best express the freshness and fruit of Beaujolais, and the delicate Chardonnay flavor of Macon. Several of these
 wines have subsequently won Gold Awards against the leading wine producers of each region. It is with great pride that we bring these
 bottles to the discriminating wine lovers of America.
 Each of the nine wines listed below are 'best of class'-the finest wines that Beaujolais ' premier wine producer has to offer. We urge you to
 try them. Once you do, we're sure you will agree .

   1979 REDBORDEAUX
 Is 1979 a great year? How does it compare to the '78s, '75s and '6ls? We asked Philippe Cottin, Managing Director of Chateau Mouton-Rothschild and he re-
 spondedÂ·: .. 1979 does not have the intensity or high tannin that marks the '45s, '61sand '75s, but it compensates with an abundance of fruit, soft charm and a
 promise of superb development ahead. It is in the style of the outstanding 1959 vintage and in my book-it is a winner!"

 Our in-depth Spring visit to Bordeaux confirmed this opinion. The excellence of the year now recognized by the wine drinkers of the world has forced the prices
 upward 30% on the Bordeaux market in a short span of 4 months. The process will continue. Now is the time to buy. Order now-delivery during 1982.

   I recall with much warmth the days immediately after World War II when I was a consultant
   to Sherry-Lehmann. At that point in history, wine was not yet a familar potable-it was bourbon,
   scotch, gin and vodka that dominated the drinking habits of America. We at Sherry-Lehmann,
   however, did what we could to introduce Americans to the wonderful world of wine .
   Now, a wine revolution has taken place. Thanks to world travel, wine columns in newspaper
   and magazines, wine seminars and tastings, the role of wine on the American scene has grown
   dramatically.
   As is generally known and accepted, the better wines of Europe and America reach their full apex
   of satisfaction when stored properly and served in gracious fashion. WINECAVESis dedicated to
   the discovery of wine accessories (and, in some instances, unique food items) which give a new
   dimension and added pleasure to the joyous act of storing, serving and drinking wine. Browse

 Creates a 'Wine Library' in your home

 Here is the pe rfect answer to where you can store your wines so they are conveniently
 accessible-and attractively displayed. Made of handsome, dark hardwoods, with black iron
 braces, this wine rack has been available exclusive ly at the notable Madison Avenue wine shop, Sherry-Lehmann. But now this useful and
 decorative modular unit is being offered to wine lovers everywhere . The Sherry-Lehmann 'Chateau Wine Rack' has been duplicated
 many times-with lighter, less-durable woods and galvanized-steel braces-but none has been as sturdy or as handsome as the wine
 library rack we offer here.

 The Sherry- Lehmann 'Chateau Wine Rack' is easy to assem ble. It measures 12Â¾" x 16Â½" x 9" deep, and can stand either horizon-
 tally or vertically, as best suits your available space . By itself, it holds up to sixteen bottles. However, the beauty of the 'Chateau Wine Rack'
 is in its ability to be stacked 'ad infini tum'to create a veritable 'wine library' holding as many bottles as you wish. Create an entire wall of
 vinea l delights - or, if cautious , order a few racks now, and reorder in the future when your cellar needs expand . Here is a versatile method
 to keep your bo ttles properly cradled while adding prestige, beauty and drama to your living space .


 Note : Specially designed wood-strip "spacers" are necessary to assure the sturdiness of stacking one wine rack atop another.
 Two "spacers" - one placed on each upper corner-are needed before the next wine rack can be firmly positioned on top.

   A Authentic Tastevin
   When the cellar-master reverently goes down
   to the cellar to taste the wine ageing in barrel ,
   he takes along with him a'tastevin'to judge the
   wine . The hollowed curves of the 'tastevin'
   allow him to examine the wine's color and
   clarity .The shallow bowl is just large enough to
   hold a small mouthful-all that is necessary to
   taste the variety of essences needed to discern
   the wine 's character. The sommeliers of the
   finer restaurants also use this classic approach
   to winetasting. The traditional tastevin is now
   available for your use . Imported directly from
   the same French artisans who supply the
   vignerons of Burgundy and Beaujolais. Hand-
   crafted, in heavy silverplate .
    $24.95

   B Champagne Cork Tongs
   Did you ever have a Champagne cork that did
   not want to leave the bottle? Here is a hand-
   some, handy device that will end the struggle
   and allow you to enjoy your Champagne and
   your guests. The silverplated tongs easily
   encircle the Champagne cork for a firm hold.
   Imported from France , where it is a favorite of
   the Champagne growers.

   C Wine Funnel and
   Cork 'Presentoire'
   When you have that very special bottle of old Bordeaux that deserves the best
   of care and presentation. The silverplated funnel handsomely sits atop most
   decanters . Its slanted stem allows the wine to trickle along the side of the
   decanter, thus aerating the wine as it is being poured . The silverplated grape-leaf
   'presentoire ' gracefully holds the identifying cork, to be placed around the neck
   of the decanter. Beautifully presented in giftbox .
      $89.95

   D Dripless Wine Pourer
   No further need to worry about your antique lace tablecloth. This elegant, little
   silverplated wine pourer has been ingeniously designed with a double silver-lip
   to catch the small drops that often escape from the bottle just after the wine has
   been poured . Fits any size bottle. Imported. from Italy.

  to let the wine 'breathe ' and expand to its full potential.




 The New
 SCREWPULL
 Improved for 1981!
 Here is the greatest contribution to wine since the invention of the
 corkscrew . Since its introduction just over a year ago, the Screwpull has
 already won over 100,000 converts. And now the impossible has been
 done! The original Screwpull has been improved! The neck of this mag-
 nificently simple device has been elongated to allow disgorging of even
 the longest of corks, and holds the cork snugly once it has been extracted
 from the bottle.

 Terry Robards, noted wine editor of the New York Times, recently wrote
 in his WINETALKcolumn, "Mr. Allen, a Texan, is a highly successful inven-
 tor with some 300 patents in the oil field equipment [who] has advanced the
 corkscrew in a quantum leap ... The Screwpull comes closer to infallibility
 then any other device for extracting corks, and it is so simple that anybody
 can use it successfully ... When I was invited recently to uncork a very old
 expensive bottle of Chateau Lafite, I considered only one tool, the
 Screwpull!'

 This is the only corkscrew you will ever need. Made of molded plastic
 housing a teflon-like coated wire screw, the simplicity of its design and its
 ease in handling will spoil you forever.

    PERRJER-JOUET CHAMPAGNE
    COOLER AND STEMWARE
    The Champagne House of Perrier-Jouet was founded in 1811, in the
    middle of the Napoleonic Wars. By the mid-1850s, the firm already had a
    highly distinguished clientele, which included Napoleon Ill and Queen
    Victoria. Perrier-Jouet has always maintained its small size, specializing in
    first-class Champagnes only.
    Perrier-Jouet is perhaps best known for their exquis ite hand-painted
    'flower bottle' which holds the finest reserves of the firm's famed Cham-
    pagnes. To celebrate the success of its unique floral design, Perrier-Jou et has
    gone a step further-they have designed a beautiful Champagne cooler with
      94
    matching stemware to accompany their famous bottle. The charming motif
    is enamelled by hand, and oven-baked to bring out all the nuances of that
    age-old process. The white petals are tinged with pink, and gold-leaf en-
    circles both petals and stem. The 'art nouveau ' look is beautifully brought
    to flower here.
