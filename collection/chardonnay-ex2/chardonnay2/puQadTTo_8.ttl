        schema:description  "In 1953, Stony Hill Vineyard provided James D. Zellerbach the chardonnay budwood that was used to plant Hanzell Vineyards.  Because the Wente brothers were widely respected for their efforts to perfect California chardonnay, Zellerbach sought out the Wente clone when planting his 1953 Ambassador's Vineyard. He continued Wente's practice of evaluating selection, gradually establishing vines perfectly adapted to the growing conditions of Sonoma. Today the vines are known as the Hanzell clone." ;
