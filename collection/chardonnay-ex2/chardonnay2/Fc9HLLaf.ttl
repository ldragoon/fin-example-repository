        schema:description  "After Prohibition, Frank Schoonmaker, a New York merchant, was instrumental in the California wine industry's recovery after repeal. Schoonmaker founded Frank Schoonmaker Selections in 1936 and included California chardonnay in his portfolio. Schoonmaker, who was critical of the common practice of naming California wines after French winegrowing regions, labelled his selections under the founder's name, followed by variety, producer, and region.  While Schoonmaker was selling Wente chardonnay on the East Coast, Wente was also using varietal labelling for their wines distributed on the West Coast. Like Schoonmaker, Ernest Wente believed that the long-term success for the winery was rooted in consumer education, and that varietal labelling was one step in that process. In 1936 Wente was the first California winery to produce a wine labeled as chardonnay.  #Connections#Link to Learn More#Image Credit\nWente Vineyards" ;
