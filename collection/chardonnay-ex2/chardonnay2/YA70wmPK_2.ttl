        schema:description  "In 1946, Fred and Eleanor McCrea collected budwood from Wente's Livermore vineyard to plant the Stony Hill vineyard in the Spring Mountain District of Napa Valley. At the time, the decision to plant chardonnay was controversial, as there were only around 200 documented acres of chardonnay in California. Stony Hill may have been the first winery to plant a chardonnay vineyard after Prohibition, and the McCreas did so despite warnings from UC Davis that the variety was unlikely to succeed. UC Davis advised the couple to plant gewurztraminer, s√©millon and pinot blanc to protect against the potential failure of the chardonnay." ;
