    "description" : "After Prohibition, Frank Schoonmaker, a New York merchant, was instrumental in the California wine industry's recovery after repeal. Schoonmaker founded Frank Schoonmaker Selections in 1936 and included California chardonnay in his portfolio. Schoonmaker, who was critical of the common practice of naming California wines after French winegrowing regions, labelled his selections under the founder's name, followed by variety, producer, and region.  While Schoonmaker was selling Wente chardonnay on the East Coast, Wente was also using varietal labelling for their wines distributed on the West Coast. Like Schoonmaker, Ernest Wente believed that the long-term success for the winery was rooted in consumer education, and that varietal labelling was one step in that process. In 1936 Wente was the first California winery to produce a wine labeled as chardonnay.  #Connections#Link to Learn More#Image Credit\nWente Vineyards",

These scientists develop methods for grape virus disease detection and disease elimination. A large collection of disease-tested wine, table, raisin and rootstock grape selections was created which became the foundation for the California Grapevine Registration & Certification (R&C) Program. The FPMS later changed its name to Foundation Plant Service (FPS) and continues its work on the current Foundation Vineyards of over 100 acres.

Stony Hill may have been the first winery to plant a chardonnay vineyard after Prohibition, and the McCreas did so despite warnings from UC Davis that the variety was unlikely to succeed.
