  It is the Merlot grape that gives the softness and grace to the red wines of Bordeaux, where it is only second in

  The 1962 white Burgundies are truly wonderful - light, racy and with more bouquet than even the
  excellen t '61s; they are not as lon g-lived as the '61s, but are perhaps better balanced, quicker to
  mature. They will bring delight to the wine drinker for the next three or four years.

  The report is now in on th e '64s white Burgundi es. Th ey ar e generally soft, not high in acidity and

  The fresh, light, tart white wine made from the Folle Blanche grape around Nantes, near the mouth of. the Loire. It
  is the wine that the natives drink most copiously with the oysters gathered from the nearby sea. This marks the
  first time that this wine - so perfect with seafood - has been imported into the United States. Its thirst-quenching
  qualities are sheer perfection with delicate summer menus.

  of carafe wine. Available in half bottles at 94Â¢ each, $20.15 the case.

 431 MUSCADET-SUR-LIE 1964, Barre
      ~Ill,
  The lees is the heavy sediment which young wines throw in barrel. These are left behind when the wine is
      TH
  "racked" or transferred from one barrel to another. This Muscadet was slowly and carefully taken from the barrel
  by hand, not to disturb the sediment at the bottom. It is a costly process, and is wasteful of wine. However, the
  reward is a rich, intense, and exceedingly flavorsome Muscadet that will prove astonishingly good to many of
  you. Less than 100 cases were produced in this fashion.

 We quote from a letter just received from Alexis Lichine, the author of 'The Wines of France': "in Beaujolais,
 the yield was comparatively small, due to excessive pre-harvest ?ryness ..The reds are excel_lent ... the fact
 that the yield was over 30% less than in 1963 is being reflected m the pnc~s. The good Cuve~s h~ve all. been
 spoken for. In quality, the reds are better than the 1962s ... They are certamly the bes! ~eau1olais available
 today, and in particular Grand Cru Beaujolais. Will not disappoint even the most critical."

  BURGUNDY-"VINTAGE
   OF THE CENTURY"
 Let us forget about the lesser wines of '59 because their fruit and charm, delightful at the beginning, have
 now expended themselves. The very best of the 1959s are still slowly improving - are showing their superb
 qualities; should be consumed, except for a few of the giants, during the next five years.

  PERFECT WEATHER AT
 1962
    GREATRED BURGUNDIES
  -VINTAGE HAS PRODUCED
 Lovers of fine red Burgundy can be grateful for 1962, a year that developed much better than originally
 anticipated. Perfect weather at vintage time confounded the oracles of doom and produced red Burgundies
 that can truly be called "great." Quick to mature, of perfect balance, rich in fruit and charm - there are
 almost no failures among the 1962 reds. Though not quite as long-lived as the 1961s, a veritable Fort Knox in
 terms of longe vity , they will prove delightful now as well as five years hence. Don't ignore 1962 - a very,
 very excellent year.

  DOJIAINE
   DE LA B01"1ANEE CONTI . . â¢
  Of the '62 , '61 and '58 vintages
    ... an available for immediate delivery.
 Perhaps the rarest and most sought after red wine of the world are those produced by the DOMAINE DE LA ROMANEE
 CONTI. The production is small , and each of thes e four vineyards are rationed among the discriminating win e drinkers
 of Paris, London and New York. Experts concede they are expensiv e, but worth the price. The best values here, dollar
 for dollar, are certainly the remarkable'58s which have now acquired enoug h bottle -age to give you the perfect finish that
 only maturation can impart. Romanee Conti's neighbors did not produce a great wine in 1958 because they picked too
 early. However, Comte de Villaine, the proprietor, had the courage to 'risk all ' by waiting three weeks longer before
 harvesting. His gamb le succeeded - on e of the best of the Domaine's wines produced since the war , despite that it is an
 unfashionable vintage, is certainly their 1958s.
 A word about the Domaine 's 62's - two months of perfect weather, lasting through the vintage, produced one of the best
 vintages in a decade and deserves the appellation "great." In the league with the classic '61s; will mature more quickly;
      ofth
      one
 and thus can be enjoyed sooner. As for the '61s, these are th e kind of wines that should be laid down now and not
      authori7.,J
 touched for at least another five years.

 No Bon Voyage gift can be more appreciated, or be better timed, than iced Champagne delivered in the gay, spirited
 "Le Can-Can" - delivered at the moment when it is most needed - when friends are gathered in the stateroom ready
 to lift their glasses in a farewell toast.
 >ugh
 Not only is this gift imaginative, gay and symbolic, but it need not even be very costly. Simply pick your favorite Cham-
 fine
 pagne below (whether it be one, three, or a dozen bottles) and add only $2.95 additional to the cost of "Le Can-Can."
 "Le Can-Can" has many after uses for the boat traveller - as an extra carry-all; a wine-cooler in the stateroom, etc.
 And, should you be sailing yourself, do not overlook ordering several bottles of Champagne iced in "Le Can-Can" for
 your own Bon Voyage party, - it is delivered to the stateroom before sailing time; there is no anxious waiting for the
 wine to get cold, and the farewell party can begin the moment the first well-wisher arrives.

  Dear Messrs.
   Aaron:
  We are proud to inform you that Barrel No. 9204 of our 1959 "Kaseler
  Hi tzlay-Herrenberg Beerenauslese" recently won the highest wine award of
  Germany, before a group of connoisseurs, including the Minister of .
  Interior, Steubinger. Bestowed on it was the fabulous "Weinpreis" as the best
  single wine produced in Germany during the. great 1959 vintage in competition
  with the best of the Rheingau, Pfalz, Moselle, Saar and Ruwer.

  Though we are proud of this great honor,
    we must let you know that there
  ~~ 240 bottles in existence. Except
    for a few that we must keep for
  our personal
   family
   reserve
    and state
    occasions, the remainder are being
     ~
  reserved
   for
   you.

  The balance, fruit, distinction has hit a new high mark in our white wine tasting experience. It is the kind of
  wine that one does not serve with food, but by itself, reverently, and to quote our Germany wine friends, -
  'on bended knee.' Upon opening, the bouquet fills the air like a flower garden; it should be lingered over
  to capture the maximum bouquet. It is a true 'conversation piece' and glory. To offer its delight to a maximum
  number of wine lovers, we must limit the sale to bottles, rather than cases. We suggest early acquisition,
  because surely all of these will be spoken for quickly. Available for delivery in July. Fuder 9204

  Proud recipient of the Golden Kammerpreismunze. A powerful, dramatic wine that nevertheless retains
  softness. The best barrel of the famed Josephshof vineyard, owned for over a century by the Kesselstatt
  family. Although in the township of Graach, the Josephshof is directly adjacent to Wehlen and is the equal
  of the greatest Wehlener - rich, full-bodied, big and fine. Available in July.

  Received the coveted Gold Award of Kammerpreismunze. This wine has a wonderful uncloying sweetness;
  soft, dramatic bouquet, and pleasant balance. It is this very wine that was chosen to be served at the banquet
  at Bonn, in honor of the visit of our late President, John F. Kennedy, to Germany. Quantity limited.

  JOSEPHSHOEFER TROCKENBEERENAUSLESE
  Not only received the Golden Kammerpreismunze, but the Honor Prize of the State. The sweetest, richest,
  most dramatic and most expensive of the German wines. Each individual grape, not the cluster, is left on the
  vine until it is so ripe that it is practically as bone dry as a raisin (Trocken). This can only happen in a
  very great year and the yield is infinitesimal. Generally, the cost in labor and in acreage overhead is higher
  to the grower than even the fantastic price he must get for the wine. However, this is done more as a
  labor of prestige and love rather than of profit. A breathtaking wine. Available in July .
