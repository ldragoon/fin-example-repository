American wines are of two distinct kinds: Those produced from the
hybrids of American vines and those from the European varieties planted
in California. California’s finest table wines, red and white are produced
in the cooler regions of the State, particularly on the hillsides and in the
valleys of the counties that spread out fan-wise around San Francisco bay.
The counties which produce the best wines are, Napa, Sonoma, Alameda
and Santa Clara. The Livermore Valley in Alameda county is noted for
its white wines of the white Bordeaux type. The wines of the Santa Cruz
foothills in Santa Clara county both red and white, are distinguished for
their delicacy and excellent balance. The Napa Valley and the county
of that name is more famous for its fine full-bodied reds than for its
whites. The Sonoma Valley to the west produces a great deal of very

good full-bodied red wines as well as white of great spriteliness and
delicacy.

SPANISH WINES

Spain, which is famous for its Sherry, would be famous for its red
and white table wines even if Sherry were not produced in that country.
Of these, the best are probably grown along the banks of the River Ebro

in the northern part of the country and are known as Rioja Wines.
