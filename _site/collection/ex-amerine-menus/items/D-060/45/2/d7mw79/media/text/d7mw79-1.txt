The wines listed here have been carefully and especially
chosen in the lush vineyards of France, Italy and the United States
by Alexis Lichine author of the recently published “Wines of
France”. The greatest wines come from France and the wines of
this century are the finest in the history of man. Thus, we en-
deavor to feature selections which would make our list one of the

best of any cellar “afloat.”

All of our Bordeaux are Chateau-bottled from recognized
vineyards and featured at prices we believe to be unduplicated on
either side of the Atlantic. The Burgundies have been selected
not from large commercial firms, but from small growers who
have tended the grape from vine to final personal bottling process,
commonly referred to as estate-bottling. Our German wines consist
mainly of original bottlings, or “original abfullungs”.

Our large selection of Italian wines includes representation
from most of the outstanding districts. In selecting American wines
we have concentrated on several great growing centers. Included
on our list are choice examples of district wines of the best California

grape varieties.
