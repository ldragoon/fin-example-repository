The Bordeaux district is the largest fine wine producing area of
the world. For a thousand years wine has been the mainstay of their
economy and the people of Bordeaux pepper their conversation with
talk of wine the way Brooklynites seem to get the flow of conversation
around to baseball. The best vineyards of Bordeaux bottle their own
wines under their own label and these superior wines are known
as chateau-bottlings. Chateau bottled wines were classified in 1855 as to
their degree of greatness into five growths, or five categories. A great
wine is usually defined as one that is true to type, excellent year after
year, and long-lived. Bordeaux wines became celebrated at the time of
Louis XIV, when friends of the dashing Duc de Richelieu, knowing his
love for burgundy wines, foisted a bottle on him with a fake label which
converted him to the charms of Bordeaux wine.

We believe each and every Bordeaux listed here to be an excep-
tionally good value.

WHITE BORDEAUX

White Bordeaux range from dry Graves to sweet Barsacs and still
sweeter Sauternes. Graves means “gravel” in French and the grapes that

go into this wine are grown on gravely flatlands. But these golden grapes
produce a wine that is as soft and mellow as the gravel that gave it life

is hard.

All these superb wines are chateau-bottled and come from some of
the best vineyards in their respective districts.
