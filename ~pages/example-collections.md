From here, we can look at some of the example collections in this project and
see how data can be added and maintained in our repository.

- [Example 1](../collection/ex1-pets) This is the most
  simple example of adding data into the repository.  The data is born digital,
  and the organization of the data and the metadata is very basic.

- [Example 2](../examples/ex2-photos) This example explains how
  to document physical objects, in this case historical photos, and their
  associated digital representations.

- [Example 3](../examples/ex3-sherry-lehmann) Here, we show how you
might organize objects that have multiple digital encodings, in this case where
each catalog has a complete PDF file, but we also have each page as an image.
