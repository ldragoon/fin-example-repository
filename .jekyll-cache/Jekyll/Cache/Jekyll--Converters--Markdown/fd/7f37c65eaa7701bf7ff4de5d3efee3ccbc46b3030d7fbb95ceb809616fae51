I"Z<p>From here, we can look at some of the example collections in this project and
see how data can be added and maintained in our repository.</p>

<ul>
  <li>
    <p><a href="../collection/ex1-pets">Example 1</a> This is the most
simple example of adding data into the repository.  The data is born digital,
and the organization of the data and the metadata is very basic.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p><a href="../examples/ex2-photos">Example 2</a> This example explains how
to document physical objects, in this case historical photos, and their
associated digital representations.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p><a href="../examples/ex3-sherry-lehmann">Example 3</a> Here, we show how you
might organize objects that have multiple digital encodings, in this case where
each catalog has a complete PDF file, but we also have each page as an image.</p>
  </li>
</ul>
