This project contains a set of example repositories for the UC Davis digital
archive management system [DAMS](https://digital.ucdavis.edu).  These examples
are often, but not always found on the [DAMS
Sandbox](https://sandbox.dams.library.ucdavis.edu), a test DAMS for UC Davis.

This example repository is meant to fill two roles. First, there are a number of
different example repositories that illustrate various aspects of how we
organize data in the DAMS and methods we use to add data into the DAMS.  In
addition to the organization, we also use these examples to illustrate various
ervices that are available through our DAMS.  These example repositories then
attempt to standardize how data should be added to the system.

There are a few examples that should probably be done in order, [Pets] and
[Photos]. After that, the examples can be looked at in pretty much any order.

There are also a number of
[FAQS](https://github.com/UCDavisLibrary/fin-example-repository/issues?utf8=%E2%9C%93&q=is%3Aissue+label%3AFAQ)
in the Issues. You may find help there as well.
